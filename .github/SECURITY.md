# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to maintaining the security of our users and the integrity of our projects. We only support the **latest stable version** of the `FluentPDF-AI-Powered-Text-to-Speech-Web-App`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage you to report any security vulnerabilities you find in our projects. Please follow these steps to ensure a timely and effective response:

1.  **DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. This includes including sensitive information or proof-of-concepts.
2.  **DO NOT** create a pull request that fixes a security vulnerability without prior discussion. This is to ensure we coordinate the release and disclosure effectively.
3.  **PREFERRED METHOD:** Send a detailed report to `chirag.dev.sec@protonmail.com`. Please include:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The affected version(s) of the software.
    *   Any suggested remediation steps.
    *   (Optional) A proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability.
4.  **ALTERNATIVE METHOD (FOR URGENT ISSUES):** If you cannot use email, you may create a **private bug report** via GitHub's security advisory features. Please use the `SECURITY.md` file within the repository as a guide for what information is expected.

## Vulnerability Handling

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **48 business hours** and will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the issue. We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities as quickly as possible, typically within **7-14 days**.

## Disclosure Timeline

We aim to follow a responsible disclosure process. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is developed, we will coordinate the release of information to the public. We will not disclose any information about the vulnerability until it has been resolved and a new version has been released.

## Supported Technologies

This security policy applies specifically to the `FluentPDF-AI-Powered-Text-to-Speech-Web-App` project. For details on the technologies and versions supported, please refer to the project's `README.md` and `package.json` (or equivalent dependency manifest).
